# MASTER_PLAN — God Function Remediation

**Last updated**: 2026-04-28 (post convergence-toolchain-gates v1.58.0 release)
**Status**: God-fn epic T0 complete; T1 still paused, stashed for later resume. Convergence-toolchain-gates **shipped v1.58.0** — full 3-phase pipeline (build + anatomy-park + szechuan-sauce) on codex backend, 25 tickets + 78 anatomy-park findings + szechuan god-fn decomposition, all gates green, 2889/2889 tests pass. Cronenberg meta-router shipped earlier as v1.57.0. Stall-recovery PRD still drafted, not started.

## 2. Today's session — 2026-04-26 / 2026-04-27

T0 completed cleanly after a marathon debug session that surfaced and fixed five distinct PRC infrastructure bugs. The release line below is the actual deliverable from this session, alongside T0.

### Releases shipped this session

| Version | Bug fixed |
|---|---|
| `v1.56.0` | Pickle phase didn't pin `command_template`; stale `anatomy-park.md` misrouted resumed workers. Added phase-entry helper `enterPicklePhase()` that pins template + scrubs foreign-phase JSON files. Also added `ignore_dirty_paths` (default `prds/`, `docs/`) to clean-tree check. Microverse pre-flight applies same exclusion + auto-commit stages untracked files. Master plan moved to `prds/MASTER_PLAN.md`. |
| `v1.56.1` | Worker prompt "Write ONLY to `${TICKET_DIR}`" — codex took literally and refused all repo writes. Disambiguated to name ticket-artifact files explicitly and authorize Steps 5/8 to write to project working tree. |
| `v1.56.2` | 38 timing-sensitive tests bumped 3–5x to survive load when codex runs concurrent tool calls during baseline capture. Verified under 2x concurrent runs. |
| `v1.56.3` | Morty workers leaked orchestrator promise tokens upstream. Added `FORBIDDEN_WORKER_TOKENS` + runtime scrub in `spawn-morty.ts` finalize-time, plus prompt-level forbidden list. |
| `v1.56.4` | **Manager itself misuses EPIC_COMPLETED** — conflates per-ticket completion with epic completion. Replaced fail-loud guard with `evaluateEpicCompletion()` recovery state machine: 4-arm decision (genuine / recover_advance / recover_retry / persistent_hallucination). Pipeline survives manager hallucination structurally. Counter persists in `state.false_epic_completed_count`. **This is the fix that finally let T0 complete.** |
| `v1.57.0` | **Cronenberg meta-router shipped** (post-stash, 2026-04-27). New `/cronenberg` skill — explicit-invocation deterministic router that picks the right pickle metaphor + cleanup chain for a build/implement request. Tmux-detach-safe, flag pass-through, persona footprint = one Dispatch line. Unrelated to the god-fn epic; shipped as a side-quest. |
| `v1.58.0` | **Convergence-toolchain-gates shipped** (2026-04-28). New `convergence-gate` primitive (`runGate({mode,scope,checks,allowedPaths})`) + `finalize-gate.ts` post-runner orchestrator + `morty-gate-remediator` agent (mechanical-only autofix worker with snapshot-and-revert protocol) + `check-gate.ts`/`spawn-gate-remediator.ts` CLIs. Wires into `/szechuan-sauce` (line-205 tmux chain) and `/anatomy-park` (Step 6.6 baseline + line-166 chain). 14 new activity events, `iteration_regressions` counter on `MicroverseSessionState`, `gate-commands.json` for pnpm/npm/yarn/cargo/go, baseline schema with `(file, ruleOrCode, occurrence_index)` fingerprint, freshness invariants, R17 OOS handling, R18 dirty-worktree skip, R19 baseline-stale halt, R20 bootstrap recursion (gate-the-gate). Anatomy-park run on this PR exercised the gate against itself and found 78 cross-cutting bugs (CRITICAL/HIGH) across pickle-rick — all fixed in-loop. LOA-618 fixture replay test pinned. Final fixes pre-release: metrics-utils `git log --since` semantic bug (date-only boundary) + worktree commit attribution + 2 P1 findings in convergence-gate.ts (unsafe `as string` cast on empty cmd, silent error swallow on race). |

### T0 deliverables landed

- `extension/REFACTOR_BASELINE.md` — captured `npm test`/`tsc`/`eslint` baseline at HEAD `c205292`
- `extension/REFACTOR_FEASIBILITY.md` — feasibility proof for `_emitDot`/`mux-runner main` extractions, all helpers under cyclomatic-15 ceiling
- `extension/eslint.config.js` — added warn-level `complexity` (15) and `max-lines-per-function` (120) rules + per-file 200-LOC carve-outs for `dot-builder.ts` and `microverse-runner.ts`
- `extension/scripts/smoke-deployed-hooks.sh` — exec'able, exits 0 against deployed stop-hook (verified)
- `extension/tests/fixtures/dot-builder/` — 8 golden DOT fixtures (catastrophic-recovery, competing, convergence, fan-out, isolated-workspace-convergence, microverse, review-ratchet, sequential)
- `extension/tests/fixtures/{microverse,mux-runner,setup,spawn-morty,stop-hook}/` — token, schema, version, mutation fixtures
- T0 frontmatter `status: "Done"`

### What ate the day (so the next session has the receipts)

- v1.56.0 was the structural unblocker — without it, every resume picked up an `anatomy-park.md` template and the codex worker dutifully ran the wrong skill.
- v1.56.1 — codex is a literalist. Any prompt rule with "ONLY" or "NEVER" is read absolutely, even when context makes the intended scope obvious. Future prompt edits in this codebase: enumerate scopes explicitly; never use "ONLY" as a hard constraint.
- v1.56.4 worked exactly as designed: the v1.56.4 run logged **18 `MANAGER_FALSE_EPIC_COMPLETED` markers** during T0 alone. Every one of those was a hallucinated epic completion that would have killed the pipeline pre-fix. Recovery state machine caught all 18.

### Why the run still stopped

After T0 landed and codex advanced to T1 (`f068af3f` — Split `_emitDot`, the largest god function), codex ran for 5 iterations doing research/plan analysis without making implementation commits. Mux-runner's circuit breaker (separate from the EPIC_COMPLETED recovery — this one watches actual progress like ticket-status changes and commits) tripped at iteration 8 and exited. **This is not a hallucination — it's that T1's complexity (905 LOC, 6 helpers, 8 new tests) exceeded codex's per-iteration thinking budget.**

T1 status reset to `Todo` so resume starts fresh.

## 3. Current state (verified on disk, 2026-04-27 13:21Z)

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Session root | `~/.local/share/pickle-rick/sessions/2026-04-25-9152e64b/` |
| `state.json: active` | `false` |
| `state.json: step` | `research` |
| `state.json: current_ticket` | `f068af3f` (T1) |
| `state.json: command_template` | `pickle.md` ✅ (v1.56.0 fix held) |
| `state.json: false_epic_completed_count` | `18` (proof v1.56.4 fired and recovered) |
| `pipeline-status.json` | `failed` (circuit-breaker exit; not relaunch-blocking) |
| `pipeline-cancel` sentinel | absent |
| Working tree | 5 untracked PRD drafts (`bmad-inspired-hardening`, `citadel`, `convergence-toolchain-gates`, `deepseek-integration`, `large-tier-stall-recovery`) + this `MASTER_PLAN.md` modification. No code-level dirt. |
| Source tree | T0 deliverables committed; no in-flight T1 edits |
| tmux | `pipeline-9152e64b` is dead. |
| Tickets done | 1 of 20 (T0 / `6f3e3f01`) |
| Tickets in progress | 0 (T1 reset to Todo) |
| Tickets pending | 19 |

T1 has research/plan artifacts on disk from the failed run (5 worker-session logs, plan/research markdown). Resuming T1 will reuse those if the prompt instructs, or restart fresh if cleared.

---

## 4. Resume strategy

### Option A: hand-execute T1 with claude backend (recommended)

T1 is mechanical extraction (split `_emitDot` into 6 topology helpers + 2 inline post-passes per the refined PRD). Codex stalled on it because of complexity, not capability gaps. Claude with full file context will burn through it cleanly in 30–60 minutes.

```bash
# Edit state.json directly OR launch /pickle on T1's ticket file with --backend claude
SESSION_ROOT=~/.local/share/pickle-rick/sessions/2026-04-25-9152e64b
# Switch backend for one ticket
node "$HOME/.claude/pickle-rick/extension/bin/update-state.js" backend claude "$SESSION_ROOT"
node "$HOME/.claude/pickle-rick/extension/bin/update-state.js" start_time_epoch "$(date +%s)" "$SESSION_ROOT"
node "$HOME/.claude/pickle-rick/extension/bin/update-state.js" iteration 0 "$SESSION_ROOT"
node "$HOME/.claude/pickle-rick/extension/bin/update-state.js" current_ticket f068af3f "$SESSION_ROOT"
rm -f "$SESSION_ROOT/pipeline-cancel"

tmux new-session -d -s pipeline-9152e64b -c /Users/gregorydickson/loanlight/pickle-rick/pickle-rick-claude
tmux send-keys -t pipeline-9152e64b:0 \
  "node \$HOME/.claude/pickle-rick/extension/bin/pipeline-runner.js $SESSION_ROOT; read" Enter
tmux attach -t pipeline-9152e64b
```

After T1 lands, switch `state.backend` back to `codex` for T2+ if desired — most remaining tickets are smaller-scope splits where codex performed acceptably.

### Option B: bump circuit-breaker budget for large-tier tickets, retry codex on T1

Currently 5 iterations × ~10 min = 50 min before stall. T1 needs more. Code change in `mux-runner.ts` to read `linear_ticket_*.md` frontmatter `complexity_tier` and use a tier-keyed budget (`large` = 12, `medium` = 6, `small` = 4). Modest scope, would land as v1.56.5. Then retry codex.

### Option C: pure hand-execution for T1 by user (no agent)

T1 is the kind of work a senior dev does in 90 minutes. The refined PRD has the helper signatures spelled out. If the agent loops are getting tedious, this is the fastest path to "T1 done, resume codex on T2."

Whichever option, **T1's research/plan artifacts at `$SESSION_ROOT/f068af3f/` are good context** — codex did real analysis there even if it didn't commit code. Worth reading before starting.

### Option D: full restart from T0 (NOT recommended)

T0 is committed. There's nothing to redo there. The session is genuinely past T0.

## 5. The 20 tickets (in execution order)

| Order | ID | Title | Tier | Min new tests | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | `6f3e3f01` | T0 — Pre-refactor scaffolding **[GATE]** | medium | 0 | **Done** ✅ |
| 20 | `f068af3f` | T1 — Split `_emitDot` (6 topology helpers, 2 post-passes inline) | large | 8 | Todo (research/plan staged) |
| 30 | `53caa9a4` | T2 — Split `mux-runner main` (outer loop only) | large | 4 | Todo |
| 40 | `2b4b0501` | T3 — Split `microverse-runner main` | large | 3 | Todo |
| 50 | `626cd1d5` | T4 — Split `spawn-morty main` | large | 4 | Todo |
| 60 | `5059df9a` | T5 — Split `stop-hook main` (8 token detectors) | large | 9 | Todo |
| 70 | `16efc5dc` | T6 — Split `spawn-refinement-team main` | medium | 1 | Todo |
| 80 | `7aa55af1` | T7 — Split `pipeline-runner main` (PhaseConfig dispatch) | medium | 1 | Todo |
| 90 | `f5ac5de1` | T8 — Split `setup main` | medium | 3 | Todo |
| 100 | `a6c9c59b` | T9 — Split `jar-runner main` | medium | 5 | Todo |
| 110 | `e54eebf6` | T10 — Split `build()` | small | 3 | Todo |
| 120 | `e2e6e1cc` | T11 — Split `fromSpec()` | small | 2 | Todo |
| 130 | `189df244` | T12 — Split `ensureMonitorWindow` **[TRAP DOOR]** | small | 2 | Todo |
| 140 | `bdfb528b` | T13 — Split `findImporters` **[TRAP DOOR]** | small | 4 | Todo |
| 150 | `5fa8759a` | T14 — Epic closer (ESLint→error, single 1.55.0 bump, smoke) | trivial | 0 | Todo |
| 160 | `e5e73494` | T15 — Wire (Library variant) | medium | 0 | Todo |
| 170 | `24cd1805` | Harden — code quality of refactor diff | large | varies | Todo |
| 180 | `9dbd0bfd` | Audit — data flow integrity | large | varies | Todo |
| 190 | `d6e98b45` | Harden — test quality | large | varies | Todo |
| 200 | `7be94584` | Audit — cross-reference consistency | medium | 0 | Todo |

T14's planned bump target (`1.54.2 → 1.55.0`) is now obsolete — we've already shipped `1.55.0` for an unrelated agent-teams feature (commit `a4662df`), `1.56.4` for this session's PRC fixes, and `1.57.0` for the cronenberg meta-router (commit `711f92c`). Reset T14's bump to whatever the current latest is at the time T14 lands.

Total minimum new tests from T1–T14: **49**. Hardening tickets add more as findings demand.

## 6. Cross-cutting rules (from refined PRD Approach §1–§12)

These apply to every PR in the epic — keep them in mind during code review:

1. **Atomic PRs** — one ticket per PR.
2. **Full gate per PR**: `cd extension && npx tsc --noEmit && npx eslint src/ --max-warnings=-1 && npx tsc && npm test` (plus the 3 hygiene tests fire automatically).
3. **Same-file rebase rule** — T1, T10, T11 all touch `dot-builder.ts` (non-overlapping line ranges; rebase-before-review, not strict numeric order).
4. **Test placement** — unit tests in `extension/tests/`; integration in `extension/tests/integration/`. Both append to `package.json:13`.
5. **`package.json:13` append-at-end protocol** — alphabetize once at T14, never per-PR.
6. **Single version bump at T14** — per-PR commits use `refactor(god-fn):` without bumps. Target version reset (see §5 above).
7. **Fixture lockdown** — refactor PRs cannot modify fixtures inline; mid-epic fixture updates are separate `fixture-update`-labeled PRs.
8. **Helper-signature spec rule** — every helper signature pre-declared in ticket body; discriminated unions over booleans; no mutable-ref side-effects.
9. **Trap-door preservation** — T12 must NOT touch `displayMacNotification` (sibling at `pickle-utils.ts:893+`); T13 helpers stay PRIVATE to `scope-resolver.ts`.
10. **Rollback discipline** — each PR independently revertible.
11. **Reviewer rotation** — single reviewer, ≤24h SLA.
12. **Cohesion > raw line count** — files may grow 5–15% from helper boilerplate; that's fine.

---

## 7. Open questions / pre-implementation gates

- **Reviewer assignment** — refined PRD §11 requires a named reviewer with ≤24h SLA. Not assigned yet. Decide before T1 lands.
- **Branch strategy** — refined PRD §6 originally called for `refactor/god-fn-epic` branch with single bump at T14. We've already landed multiple commits to `main` directly (release line v1.56.0–v1.56.4). Decide: continue on main per-PR, or carve out a feature branch from current HEAD for T1+? Either works.
- **Backend choice for T1** — see Resume Strategy §4 above. Default recommendation: claude for T1, codex for T2+.
- **Codex large-tier circuit-breaker tuning** — if pursuing Option B in §4, this is the implementation work.

---

## 8. Bug-class observations (record for future codex prompt design)

Codex backend exhibits a consistent class of failures we hit five times today. Each is now mitigated, but the pattern is worth documenting for future prompt authors:

1. **Codex is a literalist.** Any "ONLY"/"NEVER" rule is read absolutely. Don't write rules whose plain reading contradicts later steps in the same prompt.
2. **Codex bleeds context across nearby instructions.** If `pickle.md` (manager) and `send-to-morty.md` (worker) both define completion tokens and the worker has both in its addDirs, codex can use the wrong one. Mitigation: per-context forbidden lists, runtime token scrubbing (v1.56.3).
3. **Codex confuses scope levels.** Per-ticket completion vs epic completion both look like "I finished" to codex. Mitigation: structural recovery in mux-runner (v1.56.4) — never trust the model's claim of "epic done" without verifying ticket statuses.
4. **Codex stalls on large refactors.** Iteration budgets sized for "implement one helper extraction" don't cover "implement six". Mitigation: tier-aware circuit-breaker budgets (deferred), or hand-do large tickets.
5. **Codex tests are load-fragile.** Wall-clock-bounded tests with `{ timeout: 15_000 }` flake when codex runs them concurrent with its own tool calls. Mitigation: 3–5x budget bumps in v1.56.2.
