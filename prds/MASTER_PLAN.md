# MASTER_PLAN — Pickle Rick Engineering Lifecycle

**Updated 2026-06-01.** Live ledger the babysitter (`prds/babysitter.md`) drains each tick — kept lean on purpose (re-read every 30 min). Shipped releases + closed-finding detail live in `MASTER_PLAN-archive.md` and `git log`.

## Status

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Version (source/deployed) | **v1.92.0** — 2026-06-01 |
| Latest GitHub release | v1.90.1 (v1.81.1..v1.90.1 all tagged) |
| Active pipeline | **none — MASTER PLAN DRAINED.** B-DWF-2 ⏸️ SHELVED (row 13): its hard-gate soak surfaced a real workflow bug (ManifestSchema `format:date-time` rejected by Workflow-runtime AJV) → **FIXED standalone in `e1c322f2`** (landed on main; improves the opt-in workflow); the post-fix re-soak got all 3 analysts green but stalled on undefined synthesis input paths (soak-harness wiring). Retiring the safe-default legacy refinement path is low-value + not justified on a soak that can't cleanly validate → shelved, legacy path retained (zero regression). **11 releases shipped this session (v1.89.0–v1.92.0); 2 stale findings closed; 1 workflow bug fixed standalone.** Residue = NON-actionable: B-DWF-2 (needs a reliable soak harness before re-attempt) + #25 R-CSI (external-event-gated forensics). |
| Codex backend | `gpt-5.4` |

**Priority directive:** drain bug bundles before feature epics; P1 > P2 > P3. All feature epics (R-PGI v1.83.0 / R-PIAP v1.84.0 / R-DC v1.85.0) are shipped.

**Autonomy directive (2026-05-30):** the babysitter drains the ENTIRE plan with zero operator interaction — including the full release cycle (`git push` + `gh release create`), gated only on a green release gate + clean tree. Nothing here should require operator interaction. Sole permitted residue: external-event-gated work (#25 R-CSI needs a real concurrent-session incident to analyze).

---

## Drain Queue

The ordered worklist. Each tick the babysitter takes the top non-blocked row, launches its PRD (or authors one from the source in **Open Findings**, then launches), ships it through release, and repeats. Bugs before features, P1 > P2 > P3.

| # | Bundle | Pri | Open findings | PRD / source | Size |
|---|--------|-----|---------------|--------------|------|
| ~~3~~ | **B-PNTR** ✅ SHIPPED v1.89.0 | — | #77 closed | `prds/p2-remove-non-tmux-pickle-loop.md` — extracted `_pickle-manager-prompt.md`, removed bare `/pickle`, schema-neutral. Closer caught + fixed a latent FATAL deploy bug (template was deployed one level too deep for the runtime resolver; added explicit install.sh cp). | done |
| ~~4~~ | **B-R-MMTR** ✅ SHIPPED v1.89.1 | — | #28 + #19 closed | `prds/p1-bug-fix-bundle-r-mmtr-closeout.md` — R-ICDM-2..7 conformance audits (already-shipped intactness confirmed) + R-MMTRH heal-script + closer. Schema-neutral. Closer (babysitter-completed) stripped a spurious reliability trailer from 273a2d68 that failed audit-fix-commits. | done |
| ~~4b~~ | **B-E2E** ✅ SHIPPED v1.89.6 | — | #19 R-MMTR-6 closed | `prds/p2-bug-fix-bundle-b-e2e-mmtr6.md` (built max-turns-relaunch E2E test: 6A fixture/6B harness/6C 3-scenario test/6D CI gate; schema-neutral). Source: `p1-mmtr-6-decompose-e2e-into-sub-tickets.md`. B-WEDGE mooted original fan-out AC. Closer (this session) serialized `install-ui-principles.test.js` to close a latent real-install concurrency flake (`ln: tsc: File exists` under parallel tier load); full gate (fast 5450✓ / integration 405✓ / expensive✓) green. | done |
| ~~5~~ | **B-GATE** ✅ SHIPPED v1.89.2 | — | #39 + #40 closed | `prds/p2-bug-fix-bundle-b-gate-verify-command-safety.md` — host-tool preflight (#39) + zsh shell-glob safety (#40) via shared `verify-command-safety.ts` wired into `ac-phase-gate.ts`/`convergence-gate.ts`, forward-protection lint, trap-door pins. Schema-neutral. Closer (this session) fix-forwarded a `containsUnquotedGlobHazard` eslint-complexity error and stripped a worker-hallucinated `Resolves: prds/p1-vsge.md` trailer from the R-VSGE-2 commit that failed audit-fix-commits. | done |
| ~~6~~ | **B-PPCD** ✅ SHIPPED v1.89.3 | — | #85 closed | `prds/p2-bug-fix-bundle-b-ppcd-pipeline-citadel-phase-list-drift.md` (doc-only: citadel-omitting 3-phase claim → real 4-phase in `pickle-pipeline.md` + `persona.md`; schema-neutral). Closer (babysitter) reconciled two `pickle-pipeline-skill.test.js` pins coupled to the old wording: trimmed line-1 description to ≤80 chars (kept citadel) and updated the Step 4 `--skip-*` regex to the 4-flag form. | done |
| ~~7~~ | **B-ACSG** ✅ SHIPPED v1.89.4 | — | #84 closed | `prds/p2-bug-fix-bundle-b-acsg-ac-shape-gate.md` (NARROW H1+H3: loosen field-bound matcher + `PICKLE_AC_GATE_DEBUG`, PRD-advisory/ticket-normative decouple + `--skip-ac-shape-gate`, LOA-727 regression fixture + monotonicity + negative-corpus, trap-door pin; schema-neutral). Closer (babysitter, this session) ff-reattached an orphaned R-ACSG-3 commit (spurious worker Failed-flip), fix-forwarded a missing `ac_shape_gate_bypassed` entry in `activity-logger.test.js`'s expected-events list, and ran the full gate (fast/integration-serial/expensive all green). | done |
| 8 | **B-WEDGE** | P2 | #30 R-RSU | `prds/p2-bug-fix-bundle-b-wedge-rsu.md` (refinement over-collapse: analyst-prompt fan-out guidance + non-throwing over-collapse guard + regression; schema-neutral). Source: `p2-pickle-refine-section-umbrella-granularity-bug.md`. INDEPENDENT of B-ACSG. **SHIPPED v1.89.5 (2026-06-01).** | ~5 |
| ~~9~~ | **B-MONITOR** ✅ ALREADY SHIPPED v1.80.2 | — | #29 closed | NO BUNDLE NEEDED — stale finding note. All R-MWCL-1..7 shipped v1.80.2 (`7a22bfe1` etc.); pipeline anatomy/szechuan layout is correct via R-MDS `respawnMonitorWindowForMode`(phase→microverse) + `inferModeFromStep` render-tick (`monitor.ts:335`). Evidence: `prds/B-MONITOR-residual-assessment.md`. | done |
| ~~10~~ | **B-LSOF** ✅ SHIPPED v1.90.0 | — | #37e closed | `prds/p2-bug-fix-bundle-b-lsof-launch-git-probe.md` (extract fail-OPEN `probeConcurrentGitAccess` from cancel.ts lsof/pgrep pattern + advisory launch-time wire-in + `concurrent_git_access_detected` event; advisory-only). All 3 worker tickets self-completed (5.1/5.2/5.TD Done); closer babysitter-completed: full gate green at low concurrency (fast 5473✓ / integration 779✓ / expensive 13✓), recompiled a 1-line trap-door-comment drift in `git-utils.js`, **bumped MINOR (1.90.0) not the PRD's PATCH guess** — the new `concurrent_git_access_detected` event is a new event surface. | done |
| ~~11~~ | **R-PSAI** ✅ ALREADY SHIPPED v1.75.0 | — | #12 closed | NO BUNDLE NEEDED — stale finding. All 7 ACs (R-PSAI-1..7: scope auto-inference clause, Step 8 scope report, branch-divergence safety prompt, `lock-scope.js` recovery, `ensureMonitorWindow` watchdog, docs, regression tests) shipped v1.75.0 via `a159f959` (ticket `e789b21c`, 2026-05-09). Re-launched 2026-06-01 (session f2c93f0e) → workers found everything present, produced only 6 README doc lines. Verified in HEAD: scope clause (7), `lock-scope.js`, watchdog test, scope-inference regression tests (2). | done |
| ~~11b~~ | **B-LASP** ✅ SHIPPED v1.90.1 | — | #87 closed | `prds/p2-bug-fix-bundle-b-lasp-log-activity-schema-resolution.md`. Original framing wrong: install.sh has no schema logic and excludes `src/`, and the extension-root schema is a 112B `$ref` stub the resolver can't deref — so the deployed tree had **no real schema bytes**. The first R-LASP-1 attempt (root-first) loaded the hollow stub via naive `JSON.parse`, silently disabling validation and reddening `log-activity-gate-payload.test.js`. Closer re-scoped + re-shipped: resolver `[src/types-first, root-second]` (`922cdec2`) + install.sh copies the real schema to the deployed root, overwriting the stub; deploy-parity regression test `aaa6ae98` (R-LASP-2). Full gate green (fast 5476✓ c=4 / integration 13✓ / expensive✓). | done | ~2 |
| ~~12~~ | **B-DWF** (impl) ✅ SHIPPED v1.91.0 | P2 | (feature) | `prds/p2-dynamic-workflow-conversion-refine-prd-council.md`. R-DWF-1 spike PASSED; **R-DWF-2/4/5 shipped v1.91.0** (refine-analyze.js + council-round.js workflows + SUBAGENT_PAYLOAD_SCHEMA + skill wiring + tests, behind kill-switches; old subprocess paths remain default). R-DWF-5 mux-integration done at skill level (no mux-runner.ts edit → §27 B-PNTR concern moot). Full gate green (fast 5492 / integration 779 / expensive 13). **REMAINING (follow-up B-DWF-2):** R-DWF-3 (retire `spawn-refinement-team.ts` + watcher) is soak-gated — needs one green real-PRD soak of the workflow path first; R-DWF-6 (docs) depends on R-DWF-3. Allowlist additions = deployment-time operator decision. | done |
| 13 | **B-DWF-2** ⏸️ SHELVED | P3 | (feature — R-DWF-3/6) | `prds/p3-bug-fix-bundle-b-dwf2-retire-refinement-subprocess.md`. Hard-gate soak (R-DWF-3-SOAK) run twice: attempt 1 found a real workflow bug (`ManifestSchema format:date-time` rejected by Workflow-runtime AJV) → **FIXED standalone in `e1c322f2`** (on main); attempt 2 ran all 3 analysts green but the synthesis stalled on undefined input paths (soak-harness wiring, not workflow code). **SHELVED** — retiring the safe-default legacy refinement path is low-value and not justified on a soak that can't cleanly validate; legacy path retained (zero regression; workflow stays opt-in/default-off). **Re-attempt prereq:** a reliable soak harness that wires PRD/session/refinement paths + confirms the workflow emits a valid manifest end-to-end. | shelved |
| ~~14~~ | **B-DSEK** ✅ SHIPPED v1.92.0 | P3 | (feature) | `prds/deepseek-integration.md` — `'deepseek'` third backend (Anthropic-compat shim, honest identity; Shape A). 3 tickets: backend type+builder+dispatch (`5bdb9b0b`), 4-spawn-site env overlay (`8f6e4584`), setup.ts guards (`e2c1dc0d`). Launched directly (no refinement — PRD Technical Design mapped cleanly to tickets). Ticket-3 spurious-fail self-recovered. Closer (babysitter) fix-forwarded a complexity-16 eslint error via `resolveRemediatorCodexModel` extraction. Full gate green (fast 5507 / integration 779 / expensive 13). | done |

**Watch-only — NOT in the drain (out of scope until their gate clears):**
- **B-CSI** (#25 R-CSI) — external-event-gated: needs a real concurrent-session destructive-command incident to analyze. Re-activates on the next incident. Not operator-interaction.
- **B-CCDC** — operator-deferred by choice (maybe-later).

## Open Findings

Open only — closed-finding detail in `MASTER_PLAN-archive.md`. Priority: **P1** = data-loss / pipeline-bricking / recurrence ≥3×; **P2** = pipeline-friction / quality gap; **P3** = polish / niche. Each is the authoring source for its Drain-Queue bundle.

### P1

| # | Code | Summary | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 25 | R-CSI | Concurrent claude-session destructive-command interference (3 SIGINT incidents/36h) — DATA LOSS class | `p1-concurrent-claude-session-interference-with-running-pipelines.md`. **Watch-only — external-event-gated:** Phase 1 forensics need a real incident to analyze. Skipped by the drain; surfaces on the next incident. |
| ~~28~~ | R-ICDM | claude iteration classifier `detectManagerMaxTurnsExit` misuse — manager loop control regression | **CLOSED — SHIPPED v1.89.1 (B-R-MMTR).** R-ICDM-1 shipped; R-ICDM-2..7 conformance audits confirmed the fix intact at HEAD (reclassifier ternary, template relaxation, regression test, trap-door, event all present). |
| 77 | R-PNTR-DEPS | B-PNTR R-PNTR-1 (`d586b545`) wrongly deleted load-bearing `.claude/commands/pickle.md` (read every tmux iteration by mux-runner/pipeline-runner/jar-runner as the manager-prompt template) → `[FATAL] pickle.md not found`. Restored `40f22573`. **RE-SCOPED 2026-05-30** (operator-confirmed): `pickle.md` was dual-purpose (bare-`/pickle` command + manager template). **IMPLEMENTED R-PNTR-1..7** (session `2026-05-31-30c7524b`): extracted manager-lifecycle body to `_pickle-manager-prompt.md` (infra template via `extensionRoot/templates/`), repointed 3 consumers + `command_template` default, added schema-neutral resume remap, removed bare `/pickle`. Schema-neutral (dodges #74). **CLOSED — SHIPPED v1.89.0 (2026-05-31).** Closer (completed by babysitter) caught a latent FATAL: install.sh deployed the template to `$EXTENSION_ROOT/extension/templates/` but the runtime resolver reads `getExtensionRoot()/templates` = `$EXTENSION_ROOT/templates/`; added an explicit cp so fresh installs no longer FATAL. **B-PNTR.** |

### P2

| # | Code | Summary | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~39~~ | R-PVTA | verification commands use `rg`/`fd`/`bat`/`jq` without host-tool check → silent worker failures | **CLOSED — SHIPPED v1.89.2 (B-GATE).** `detectMissingTools` + `NON_GUARANTEED_TOOLS` in `verify-command-safety.ts`, wired as a preflight short-circuit into `runCriterion` (ac-phase-gate) + `runCheckCommand` (convergence-gate); regression tests + trap-door pins present. |
| ~~40~~ | R-VSGE | verification commands with shell-special chars error under zsh glob expansion | **CLOSED — SHIPPED v1.89.2 (B-GATE).** String-form AC commands run glob-safe (argv-form or `set -f`, no bare `shell: true`); `containsUnquotedGlobHazard` predicate + forward-protection lint + regression tests + trap-door pins present. |
| ~~84~~ | R-ACSG | AC-shape collapse-or-justify gate oscillates, false-rejects properly-consolidated analyst tickets (smell count 2→9 across 3 attempts, no monotonicity; ~9 worker quotas burned in one incident). **CLOSED — SHIPPED v1.89.4 (B-ACSG).** NARROW H1+H3 fix: loosened the field-bound matcher to read joined `title`+`acceptance_test`+`justification` text + `PICKLE_AC_GATE_DEBUG` tracing (R-ACSG-1); decoupled PRD-advisory vs ticket-normative channels + `--skip-ac-shape-gate <reason>` escape hatch with actionable per-violation errors (R-ACSG-2); LOA-727 regression fixture + same-input monotonicity + negative-corpus no-regression tests (R-ACSG-3); trap-door pin (R-ACSG-TD). H2 cycle-3 freeze + H4 convergence-cost remain out of scope (not reproduced). |
| ~~85~~ | R-PPCD | `/pickle-pipeline` skill prompt + `persona.md` routing omit citadel and assert a false phase list. Real order is 4-phase pickle → citadel → anatomy-park → szechuan-sauce. **CLOSED — SHIPPED v1.89.3 (B-PPCD).** Both docs corrected to the real 4-phase order; closer reconciled two doc-coupled test pins and redeployed via `install.sh`. |

### P3

| # | Code | Summary | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~12~~ | R-PSAI | `/pickle-pipeline` ignores branch/subset signals in operator kickoff | **CLOSED — ALREADY SHIPPED v1.75.0 (`a159f959`, ticket `e789b21c`).** Stale finding. All 7 ACs present in HEAD (scope auto-inference clause + Step 8 report + branch-divergence safety prompt + `lock-scope.js` recovery + `ensureMonitorWindow` watchdog + docs + regression tests). 2026-06-01 re-launch produced only 6 README doc lines (no real work). |
| ~~19~~ | R-MMTR | claude manager max-turns family closeout pending | **CLOSED — SHIPPED v1.89.1 (B-R-MMTR).** R-MMTR-1/5 shipped; 2/3/4 healed close-by-evidence (commits in main); 7 closer ran (babysitter). Residual R-MMTR-6 oversized E2E ticket → **B-E2E** row 4b, ✅ SHIPPED v1.89.6 — residual fully closed. |
| ~~29~~ | R-MWCL | monitor `inferMonitorMode` falls through to `'pickle'` for szechuan/anatomy | **CLOSED — SHIPPED v1.80.2.** Stale "3..7 residual" note: all R-MWCL-1..7 shipped v1.80.2. inferMonitorMode returning 'pickle' is inert by design — pipeline anatomy/szechuan layout is driven by `state.step` via R-MDS `respawnMonitorWindowForMode` + `inferModeFromStep` (`monitor.ts:335`→microverse); regression `monitor-mode-transition.test.js`. No bundle needed. |
| ~~37e~~ | R-PIWG-5 | git-isolation residual: `lsof` launch-time concurrent-access probe | **CLOSED — SHIPPED v1.90.0 (B-LSOF).** Fail-OPEN `probeConcurrentGitAccess` extracted to `git-utils.ts`, advisory wire-in at `setup.ts` launch, new `concurrent_git_access_detected` event (warn-only), trap-door pin. |
| ~~87~~ | R-LASP | Deployed `bin/log-activity.js` resolved the activity schema via a `src/types/…` path install.sh never creates → ENOENT, fail-open. **CLOSED — SHIPPED v1.90.1 (B-LASP).** Resolver now `[src/types-first, root-second]` + install.sh copies the real schema to the deployed root (overwriting the 112B `$ref` stub) + deploy-parity regression test. Verified: deployed `log-activity.js` loads the schema (0 ENOENT). |

## Engineering Rules

Detail in `extension/CLAUDE.md` + `prds/citadel.md`. Quick form:

1. **Atomic PRs** — one ticket per PR, independently revertible.
2. **Full release gate** — `cd extension && npx tsc --noEmit && npx eslint src/ --max-warnings=-1 && npx tsc && npm test` (+ audit scripts + `RUN_EXPENSIVE_TESTS=1 npm run test:expensive`). Green before tag.
3. **Source-of-truth** — edit `extension/src/*.ts` + `.claude/commands/*.md`; `bash install.sh` to deploy. Never edit `~/.claude/pickle-rick/`.
4. **Trap-door preservation** — every `extension/CLAUDE.md` invariant has an enforcing test.
5. **Hook decisions** — `"approve"` / `"block"` only.
6. **CLI guard** — `if (process.argv[1] && path.basename(process.argv[1]) === 'foo.js') { ... }`.
7. **Error handling** — `const msg = err instanceof Error ? err.message : String(err);` at boundaries.
8. **Versioning** — semver in `extension/package.json`; single bump per bundle at the closer.
9. **No dirty release** — all changes committed before tag; compiled JS matches TS source.
10. **Greenfield** — no legacy aliases, no backward-compat shims.
