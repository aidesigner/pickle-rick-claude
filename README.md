A port of the [Pickle Rick Gemini CLI extension](https://github.com/galz10/pickle-rick-extension) for **Claude Code** — bringing the same autonomous, iterative coding loop to `claude` users, with several enhancements over the original:

- **True context clearing via tmux** — `/pickle-tmux` spawns a genuinely fresh `claude -p` subprocess per iteration inside a tmux session, so each iteration starts with zero conversation history. No context drift on long epics.
- **Context clearing** — every loop iteration injects a structured session summary (phase, ticket list, task) as a system message, so Rick survives full context compression without losing his place
- **Single Stop hook** — the Gemini version requires three hooks (BeforeAgent, BeforeModel, AfterAgent); this port does it all in one, with fewer moving parts
- **Worker isolation** — Morty subprocesses run with `--no-session-persistence` and scoped `--add-dir`, so each worker starts genuinely fresh with only its ticket in context
- **Skills inlined** — Gemini's skills require `activate_skill()` calls that can fail; here they're baked directly into the command prompts
- **Jar improvements** — the Night Shift runner adds success/failure tracking and a configurable `default_manager_max_turns` setting absent from the original

## 🧬 What Is This?

Pickle Rick transforms Claude Code into a **hyper-competent, arrogant, iterative coding machine** that enforces a rigid engineering lifecycle:

  ✅ DONE (or loops again)
```

The **Stop hook** prevents Claude from exiting until the task is genuinely complete. No half-measures. No early exits. Rick doesn't quit. Between each iteration, the hook injects a fresh session summary — current phase, ticket list, active task — so Rick always wakes up knowing exactly where he is, even after full context compression.

---

## 🚀 Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/pickle "task"` | 🥒 Start the full autonomous loop |
| `/pickle-tmux "task"` | 🖥️ True context clearing — fresh subprocess per iteration via tmux. Best for long epics (8+ iterations). Requires `tmux`. |
| `/pickle-prd "task"` | 📋 Interactively draft a PRD first |
| `/eat-pickle` | 🛑 Cancel the active loop |
| `/help-pickle` | ❓ Show all commands and flags |
| `/add-to-pickle-jar` | 🫙 Save current session to the Jar for later |
| `/pickle-jar-open` | 🌙 Run all Jar tasks sequentially (Night Shift) |
| `/pickle-status` | 📊 Show current session phase, iteration, and ticket status |
| `/pickle-retry <ticket-id>` | 🔄 Reset a failed ticket to Todo and re-spawn a Morty for it |
| `/disable-pickle` | 🔇 Disable the stop hook globally (without uninstalling) |
| `/enable-pickle` | 🔊 Re-enable the stop hook |

### Flags

```
--max-iterations <N>    Stop after N iterations (default: 5)
--max-time <M>          Stop after M minutes (default: 60)
--resume                Resume from an existing session
--paused                Start in paused mode (PRD only)
```

### Tips

**`/pickle` vs `/pickle-tmux`** — Use `/pickle` for short-to-medium epics (1–7 iterations) in interactive mode with full keyboard access. Use `/pickle-tmux` for long epics (8+ iterations) where context drift is a concern — each iteration spawns a fresh Claude subprocess with a clean context window, bridged via `handoff.txt`. Requires `tmux`.

**tmux Mode — two windows** — `/pickle-tmux` creates a tmux session with two windows:
- **Window 0** (default): raw runner output — the live `claude -p` subprocess stream
- **Window 1 `monitor`**: live dashboard — phase, iteration, elapsed time, all tickets with status (`[x]` done / `[~]` in progress / `[ ]` todo), and a tail of the most recent iteration log. Refreshes every 2 seconds.

The session name and attach command are printed **before the runner starts** so you can open a second terminal and attach immediately:

```bash
tmux attach -t <session-name>   # printed by /pickle-tmux as soon as the session is ready
Ctrl+B 1                        # switch to monitor window
Ctrl+B 0                        # switch back to runner output
Ctrl+B d                        # detach (session keeps running in background)
```

**Bring your own PRD** — If a `prd.md` or `PRD.md` exists in your project root when you run `/pickle`, Rick will automatically load it instead of drafting a new one. Drop your PRD there and the interrogation phase is skipped entirely.

**Disabling Rick** — `/disable-pickle` creates a global marker file that silences the stop hook across all sessions instantly — no uninstall required. `/enable-pickle` removes it. To also drop the persona mid-session, just tell Rick directly: *"drop the Pickle Rick persona"* and he'll revert to standard Claude behavior for the rest of the session.

**Recovering from a failed Morty** — If a worker times out or exits without completing, use `/pickle-retry <ticket-id>` instead of restarting the whole epic. It archives the partial artifacts, resets the ticket to Todo, and prints the exact `spawn-morty.js` command to re-run — preserving all the work already done on other tickets.

**"Stop hook error" is normal** — Claude Code labels every `decision: block` response from the stop hook as "Stop hook error" in the UI. This is not an actual error. It means the hook is working correctly — it blocked Claude's exit and injected the session context for the next iteration. If you see it, Rick is looping as intended.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gregorydickson/pickle-rick-claude.git
cd pickle-rick-claude
bash install.sh
```

### 2. Add the Pickle Rick persona to your project

The installer deploys `persona.md` to `~/.claude/pickle-rick/`. Add it to your project's `CLAUDE.md` — appending if you already have one, or creating fresh if not:

```bash
# Already have a CLAUDE.md? Append (safe — won't overwrite your content):
cat ~/.claude/pickle-rick/persona.md >> /path/to/your/project/.claude/CLAUDE.md

# Starting fresh:
mkdir -p /path/to/your/project/.claude
cp ~/.claude/pickle-rick/persona.md /path/to/your/project/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

### 3. Run

**Recommended — tmux mode** (requires `tmux`): runs in the background with a live monitor window so Claude Code's interface stays free:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
claude
# then type:
/pickle-tmux "refactor the auth module"
```

Rick immediately prints a `tmux attach` command — open a second terminal and paste it to watch the live dashboard while it runs.

**Interactive mode** (no tmux required):

```bash
/pickle "refactor the auth module"
```

Sit back. Rick handles the rest. 🥒

### Context Clearing — Why Rick Loops Work

The single biggest advantage of the Rick loop over naive "just keep prompting" approaches is **context clearing between iterations**.

Long-running AI sessions accumulate stale conversational context. The model starts "remembering" earlier wrong turns, half-finished reasoning, and superseded plans — all of it silently influencing every subsequent response. Over enough iterations, the model loses track of what phase it's in, tries to restart from scratch, or hallucinates already-completed work.

**The Ralph Wiggum insight** (see [Credits](#-credits)) is that a simple loop — blocking the agent's exit and re-injecting a minimal, accurate context — outperforms one long conversation every time. Fresh context = cleaner decisions.

**How we accomplish it:** The stop hook injects a structured session summary into the `reason` field of every `decision: block` response:

```
=== PICKLE RICK LOOP CONTEXT ===
Phase: implementation
Iteration: 4 of 10
Session: ~/.claude/pickle-rick/sessions/2025-01-15-a3f2
Ticket: PROJ-42
Task: refactor the auth module
PRD: exists
Tickets:
  [x] PROJ-40: Set up database schema
  [x] PROJ-41: Add JWT middleware
  [~] PROJ-42: Refactor auth module
  [ ] PROJ-43: Write integration tests

NEXT ACTION: Resume from current phase. Read state.json for context.
Do NOT restart from PRD. Continue where you left off.
```

Claude Code injects this `reason` string as a **system message at the start of every new iteration** — even after full compression of the conversation history. No matter how much context gets evicted, Rick always wakes up knowing exactly where he is and what to do next.

Morty workers already get clean context naturally (each is a fresh `claude -p` subprocess). This brings equivalent resilience to Rick's long-running interactive session.

---

### Manager / Worker Model

- **Rick (Manager)**: Runs in your interactive Claude session. Handles PRD, Breakdown, orchestration.
- **Morty (Worker)**: Spawned as `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --add-dir <ticket_path> -p "..."` subprocess per ticket. Gets the full lifecycle skill set inlined in the prompt. Outputs `<promise>I AM DONE</promise>` when finished.

## 🛡️ Differences from the Gemini Version

| Gemini | Claude Code |
|---|---|
| `gemini-extension.json` | `CLAUDE.md` |
| `commands/*.toml` | `.claude/commands/*.md` |
| `activate_skill("x")` | Skills inlined directly in command prompts |
| `BeforeAgent` + `BeforeModel` + `AfterAgent` hooks | Single `Stop` hook |
| `gemini -s -y --include-directories -p` | `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --add-dir <path> -p` |
| `~/.gemini/extensions/pickle-rick/` | `~/.claude/pickle-rick/` |
| `hookSpecificOutput.systemMessage` | `reason` field in block response |

> ✅ **Jar commands** (`/add-to-pickle-jar`, `/pickle-jar-open`) are fully ported.

---

## 📋 Requirements

- **Node.js** 18+
- **Claude Code** CLI (`claude`) — v2.1.49+
- **jq** (for `install.sh`)
- macOS or Linux (Windows not supported)
